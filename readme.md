# ocp.nix

Nix expressions to build [OCP](https://github.com/CadQuery/OCP) and related projects.
Inspired by [vinszent/cq-flake](https://github.com/vinszent/cq-flake).

## Pardon the dust

OCP and CadQuery build; albeit with a couple failing tests. Cleaning up a
couple of things and adding docs are next on the docket.

## Contributing

I don't know what I'm doing. If you see something which you think could be done
better or want to contribute a package feel free to open a PR. Especially if
you know how to solve any of the [help
wanted](https://github.com/erooke/ocp.nix/labels/help%20wanted) issues.
